- I am a PhD Student at the University of California in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. I am advised by [Prof. Francesco Bullo](http://motion.me.ucsb.edu/index.html). My research primarily focusses on topics at the intersection of Control of Network Systems with applications in Neural Networks and in Mixed Agent Teams. 
- Previously, I was an undergraduate student at [Indian Institute of Technology Madras's](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) Electrical Engineering Department being advised by [Prof. Ramkrishna Pasumarthy](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ramkrishna/), in collaboration with [Stanford Cognitive & Systems Neuroscience Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/scsnl.html) studying Controllability in Brain Networks. 
- As an undergrad, I also worked extensively on Distributed Optimization, with labs in UC San Diego, University of Minnesota and in IIT Madras. I was involved with the [Computer Vision and Intelligence Group](https://iitmcvg.github.io/) at IIT Madras, working on topics in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and their applications.
- In my leisure time, I enjoy playing and watching football(soccer), I support Manchester United.
