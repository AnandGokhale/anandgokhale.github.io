- I am a 5th year Dual Degree Student(Bachelor's and Master's Degree) at [Indian Institute of Technology Madras's](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) Electrical Engineering Department being advised by [Prof. Ramkrishna Pasumarthy](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ramkrishna/). I am currently collaborating with [Stanford Cognitive & Systems Neuroscience Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/scsnl.html) on topics involving brain networks, and interpretation of fMRI data. 
- I am also working under the guidance of [Prof. Behrouz Touri](http://eceweb.ucsd.edu/~btouri/) at UC San Diego and [Prof. Soheil Mohajer](http://ipg.umn.edu/) at University of Minnesota on a project involving distributed optimization. 
- I have also been guided by [Prof. Rachel Kalaimani](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/rachel/) on a project in Online Distributed Optimization.  
- My primary research interests are Networked Control Systems, Distributed Control and Optimization, and their application in various domains. I am also interested in studying the applications of data driven and learning-based methods in networked systems. 
- I plan to pursue a PhD starting Fall 2022, in my topics of interest listed above. I consider my graduate studies as a first step towards a career in academia.
- I have also extensively worked on Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning and their applications as the head for the [Computer Vision and Intelligence Group](https://iitmcvg.github.io/) at IIT Madras
- In my leisure time, I enjoy playing and watching football(soccer).
